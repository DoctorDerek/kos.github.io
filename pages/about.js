        Our company is a privately held one, operated entirely by people living
        in the communities it services. We are pleased to support the community
        and its interests, as we have for decades. KOS' owners contribute to
        activities within the area, including select sports, hobbies and amateur
        racing. KOS has continued to grow into new technologies, and is now a
        trusted provider of Wireless and Cable solutions to customers in most of
        South Eastern Ontario.
