        reference together with these Service Terms. In the event of an

        inconsistency will be resolved by giving preference first to a Service

      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        <strong>3. How do I accept this Agreement? </strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        By using the Services or allowing Services to be installed at your
        premises, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to
        the Service Terms. If you do not agree to the Service Terms, you may not
        use the Services.
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        <strong>4. How long does the Agreement last?</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        The “<b>Term</b>” of your Agreement with KOS begins when you accept the
        Agreement and will continue until the Agreement is terminated. KOS
        provides Services to you on an ongoing month-to-month basis unless a
        Fixed Term is set by a Service Agreement. If a Fixed Term expires,
        Services will continue to be provided to you on a month-to-month basis,
        unless you cancel the applicable Service in accordance with Section 33.
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        <strong>5. Can KOS change the Agreement?</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        KOS can change the Agreement and any aspect of the Services. Before we
        make any changes to the Agreement, we will give you at least thirty (
        <b>30</b>) days’ written notice by email or letter to the contact
        information that you have provided to us or by bill insert or posting
        the notice on our Website.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        If you continue to use the Service after thirty (<b>30</b>) days from
        the effective date indicated in the notice, the new service term will
        become effective.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left font18">
        The process for the introduction of new Policies and amendments to
        existing Policies is different. New Policies are effective as of the day
        they are posted by KOS on the Website. Likewise, changes to existing
        Policies are effective as of the date that they are posted to the
        Website.

          6. What if I do not agree with a change that KOS makes to the

        </strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        If you do not agree with a change made by KOS, you may cancel the
        affected Services in accordance with Section 33.

        <strong>7. How does KOS bill me for the Services?</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        KOS will bill you monthly or quarterly depending on the Service and
        corresponding billing arrangement offered by KOS. You must pay all
        recurring and one-time charges (“<b>Fees</b>”) and all applicable taxes
        due for KOS services within fifteen (15) net days of KOS’s invoice date.
        KOS may bill in advance or in arrears for Services. Service Agreements
        may also modify the billing terms for certain Services.
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        <strong>8. How can I pay my bill?</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        You can pay your bill through auto payment or online through a bank
        account from a list of select financial institutions (provided to you
        upon request) that KOS may change from time to time, by cheque (through
        the mail), by debit, by cash or with select credit cards. You confirm
        that you are an authorized user of the credit card or bank account and
        that it is valid and has not expired. You must promptly advise KOS if
        your credit card or bank account information changes.

      <p className="text-left font18">

          9. What charges apply to late payments, rejected payments and other
          account processing actions?
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        If KOS does not receive payment within fifteen (<b>15</b>) days of the
        invoice date, you will be subject to a late payment charge of <b>2</b>%
        per month. This late payment charge accrues on a daily basis and is
        calculated and compounded monthly on the outstanding amount (26.82% per
        year) (“<b>Late Payment Charges</b>”) from the date of the first bill on
        which it appears until the date we receive that amount in full.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left font18">
        You agree that we can charge any unpaid and outstanding amount,
        including any Late Payment Charges and taxes, on your account to your
        credit card, bank account or any other payment method pre-authorized by
        you for payment of Fees.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left font18">
        Administrative charges in amounts up to $50.00 may be levied for
        administration or account processing activities in connection with your

      <p className="text-left font18">
        If you have any questions, disputes or discrepancies to report regarding
        Fees, you must do so within ninety (<b>90</b>) days of the invoice date.
        Failure to notify us within this time period will constitute your
        acceptance of such Fees. We will investigate disputes and if, at our
        sole discretion, we determine that a portion of the Fees was incorrectly
        charged, then we will reverse the disputed portion of the Fees. You must
        pay the undisputed portion of the Fees in accordance with Section 8.

        Yes. From time to time, KOS may establish policies, rules and limits
        (collectively “<b>Policies</b>”) concerning the use of the Services,
        Equipment and any products, content, applications or services used in
        conjunction with the Services or Equipment. The Policies are

        where the Services will be provided to you), phone number, and any

        provide KOS with forwarding information for final invoices or
        correspondence if your new contact information is different from the
        information we have on file. Failure to provide a forwarding address may
        result in the forfeiture of any outstanding credits or deposits on your

        You must notify KOS immediately should you suspect unauthorized use of
        the Services or if Equipment is lost or stolen. You are responsible for
        payment of all Fees and taxes charged to your account, whether
        authorized by you or not, which is why it is so important to protect
        your account and keep account information (including authorized users)

        <strong>29. Is 9-1-1 service always available over VoIP?</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        No. There are some important differences and limitations in how 9-1-1
        calling over VoIP technology operates when compared to basic and E9-1-1
        services provided over traditional landline telephone service. Please
        review this section carefully before activating, installing or using KOS
        VoIP services.
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        With both traditional basic 9-1-1 and E9-1-1 services, your call is sent
        directly to the nearest emergency response centre. In addition, with
        E9-1-1 service, your call back number and last address are visible to
        the emergency response centre call-taker. With KOS VoIP service 9-1-1
        calling, your call is sent to a national emergency call centre. When you
        make a 9-1-1 call using KOS VoIP services, you will be asked to confirm
        your location information regardless of whether that information is
        visible to the call centre operator. The call centre operator will then
        transfer your 9-1-1 call to the emergency response centre nearest your
        location. You should be prepared to provide or confirm your name,
        address and call-back number with the operator. Do not hang up unless
        you are told to do so. If your call is disconnected, immediately dial
        9-1-1 again.
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        If you are unable to speak during a 9-1-1 call and the call centre
        operator has access to a call-back number and the last registered
        address associated with your KOS VoIP service, the operator will
        transfer the call to the emergency response centre closest to that
        address. In order for emergency services to be dispatched to the correct
        address in such cases, you must ensure that the registered address that
        you have provided to is always the same as the physical address at which
        your VoIP device is located. Whenever you move the physical location of
        your VoIP device or you add a line or port a number, you must update
        your registered address accordingly. You may update your location
        information by logging-in to your customer portal and changing your
        recorded location information. Your customer portal can be accessed
        using the following url:{" "}

      <p className="text-left font18">
        If you or KOS cancels one or more of your Services that are subject to a
        month-to-month Term or if your Services are transferred to another
        provider, you must pay all outstanding fees (including any installation
        fees for Services that have been installed but not activated), taxes,
        and Late Payment Charges on your final invoice for those cancelled
        Services. One-time activation and installation fees are non-refundable.
        A re-stocking fee may apply to Equipment that you return or Equipment
        that has been ordered but not shipped. If Equipment that you have
        purchased has been shipped prior to Service cancellation, the fees for
        the Equipment are non-refundable. One-time activation and installation
        fees and restocking/Equipment fees are intended to recover costs and
        constitute a genuine pre-estimate of liquidated damages in the event
        that a month-to-month Service is cancelled. Any Equipment that you lease
        from KOS, except for certain Equipment, such as fixed wireless
        equipment, that may require a KOS technician for retrieval, must be
        returned by mail at the address listed in Section 45 within thirty (30)
        days of the date that Services are cancelled by you or KOS.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left font18">
        For month-to-month Services, KOS will provide a refund for the cancelled
        portion of monthly service Fees that you have paid in advance for
        Services. This refund will be pro-rated based on the number of days left
        in the last monthly billing cycle after cancellation.

        If you cancel a Service that is subject to a Fixed Term prior to its
        expiry, or if KOS cancels for cause your Service that is subject to a
        Fixed Term, then you must pay KOS an amount equal to fifty per cent (
        <b>50%</b>) of the remaining monthly Fees for the cancelled Service that
        would have been payable to the end of the Fixed Term, plus applicable
        taxes

        (collectively, the “<b>Cancellation Charges</b>”). You acknowledge that
