        <li>
          The KOS Member web pages are meant as personal web pages, not as
          commercial web pages. All information must be of a personal nature,
          and may not be commercial in nature or content. Non-profit
          organizations are generally also considered to be commercial in
          nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using any web pages for high volume or commercial use may incur
          additional fees or result in the removal of the material and/or access
          to this service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Linking an image, animation or other file for display on another web
          site is strictly prohibited, whether for profit or personal use.
          Kingston Online reserves the right to limit this activity with
          filtering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technical support for the “Member Web Pages” is limited to basic setup
          of the account, and questions related to directory, file placement,
          suitability and naming conventions. Kingston Online Services will not
          provide technical support for HTML design, graphic design or any other
          factor in the creation of web content.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        <strong>2. Suitability &amp; Standards</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-left font18">
        The content of web pages must meet with the standards of Kingston Online
        Services. We expect all of our clients to respect these standards when
        providing information via our KOS Member Pages over the Internet.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          All web pages must conform to Canadian broadcast standards. They must
          meet or exceed provincial or federal laws and respect all copyright
          restrictions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content which is pornographic is strictly prohibited. Nudity is not
          pornography, but in cases where Kingston Online Services is called
          upon to adjudicate, any nudity will be removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content must not exploit, discriminate against, or derogatorize race,
          sex, creed, religion, disability, or any other part of a person’s
          human or civil rights. This extends to groups and gatherings of people
          of like mind.
