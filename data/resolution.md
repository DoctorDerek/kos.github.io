At KOS we are constantly striving to provide our customers with excellent local support and service. If you feel that you have an issue with your service that you would like to address with us, please follow the steps below so that we can work together to reach a resolution. We value our customers and their input. We listen carefully to your concerns in order to provide you with the best direction and support that we can.

<u><b>Step 1.</b></u>

**Contact our local Customer Service team.** To start the process immediately and help us address your concern, please contact our friendly and knowledgeable local customer service team. Our hours of operation and contact information can be found on <Link href="/contact">our Contact page</Link>. You may also email your concern to <Link href="mailto:resolution@kos.net">resolution@kos.net</Link> where it will be reviewed promptly.

**Open a technical support ticket.** If your concern is of a technical nature and you require technical support, the hours of operation and contact information for our technical support team can be found on <Link href="/contact">our Contact page</Link>. Alternatively, you may send an e-mail to the technical support team using the form on that page. Current KOS customers can quickly and easily <Link href="https://support.kos.net/helpdesk/index.php?action=submit">open a support ticket</Link> for our team to review. Please include as much relevant detail in your e-mail as you can to help our team assess your concern.

Sometimes technical issues can be a result of a device or a service that is part of your own personal home network. Please check your devices to make sure they are functioning properly. If you are not sure, you can contact the device manufacturer or service provider (for services not provided by KOS) for additional support.

**Concerns about your bill?** If you have questions or concerns about your bill, you can contact our billing team <Link href="/contact">by phone</Link> or by sending us an e-mail at <Link href="mailto:resolution@kos.net">resolution@kos.net</Link>. Please be as specific as you can so that our service team can begin to review your account and account details right away. We've built our service agreements to be helpful and user-friendly, so reviewing your agreement with KOS may help clarify some of the billing terms for you.

<u><b>Step 2.</b></u>

**Escalation to a Senior Team Member**. If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory resolution after working through the appropriate previous step in this process you may ask a member of the service team to escalate your concern to a senior service team member. A member of this team will be in touch with you in 1 to 2 business days upon receipt of your escalation request to discuss your concern and to do their best to find an appropriate resolution. Most concerns we receive are resolved by a Senior Team Member. If your issue cannot be resolved by this team, please proceed to Step #3 of this process.

<u><b>Step 3.</b></u>

**Escalation to a Manager.** If you are still dissatisfied after speaking with a Senior Team member, you can escalate your concern to a Manager by <Link href="/contact">using our contact form</Link> and requesting an escalation in your message to us. The appropriate Manager will review your submission and will provide a response within 3 business days.
