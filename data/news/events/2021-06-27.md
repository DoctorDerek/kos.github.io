Dear KOS Customers,

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hydro One has announced that there will be a planned power outage on June 27, 2021 that will impact Kingston and Amherstview. I've included a few further details below:

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;_Hydro One is advising residents in the Kingston and Amherstview area of a planned power outage on Sunday, June 27 required for crews to safely perform scheduled maintenance and complete upgrades in the area. For the safety of our crews, equipment must be de-energized to complete the work. To reduce service disruptions and the need for future outages, we are bundling our work as much as possible to enhance power reliability and replace aging infrastructure._

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When: A planned power outage will take place on Sunday, June 27 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and will affect approximately 3,400 Hydro One customers in the Township of Loyalist, including Amherstview as well as Hydro One customers in Kingston.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This will impact towers in the area. Service will be restored as soon as power is back on. Please see https://www.hydroone.com/power-outages-and-safety/ for updates.

Thank you!
