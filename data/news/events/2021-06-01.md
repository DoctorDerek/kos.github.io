With the significant and growing concern across North America of the COVID-19 (“coronavirus”) situation, we wish
to provide you on an update on how KOS is handling this situation as it relates to our customers and employees.

We will remain fully operational. Our employees are equipped to work remotely from home. Our offices will be locked and we will only have limited staff members in our offices for equipement exchange and pick up only. Times for equipment exchanges and pick up must be arranged over the phone prior to coming to the office.

During this unprecedented event, we will help to slow the spread of the virus by limiting our employees attending the workplace. We will be communicating with our employees on a regular basis, promoting social distancing and cancelling our business travel.

We will reassess the COVID-19 situation and will provide an update if and when this situation changes.
