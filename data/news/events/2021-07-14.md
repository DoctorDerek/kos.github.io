Parts of our wireless network were damaged in the storm last night.

As a result, wireless internet services to customers in the Kingston, Sydenham, Amherst Island, Wilton, Yarker and surrounding areas have been impacted.

We currently have crews on site working to restore service as soon as possible.

Thank you,

KOS
