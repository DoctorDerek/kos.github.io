Kingston Online Services is a pioneering provider of Internet solutions, dedicated to providing quality Internet access and application hosting to its customers. Kingston Online Services is equipped with the latest in digital technology and uses multiple Internet connections to maintain the highest level of services in the region.

Kingston Online Services (KOS) has provided Southeastern Ontario with Internet access since its inception in 1993, in the Kingston Greater Area. Since February of 1995, weâ€™ve extended our services to the Quinte and Quinte West regions, where we keep offices as well.

Our company is a privately held one, operated entirely by people living in the communities it services. We are pleased to support the community and its interests, as we have for decades. KOS' owners contribute to activities within the area, including select sports, hobbies and amateur racing. KOS has continued to grow into new technologies, and is now a trusted provider of Wireless and Cable solutions to customers in most of South Eastern Ontario.

We provide services from Brighton to Gananoque, including Prince Edward County, Napanee, Belleville, Trenton and Picton as well as some of the St. Lawrence Islands. KOS also provides DSL and CABLE service to most of Ontario and Quebec, so we can often move with you. Thank you for taking an interest in our company.
