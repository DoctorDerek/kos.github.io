You must pay all recurring and one-time charges (**“Fees”**) and all applicable taxes due for KOS services within fifteen (15) net days of KOS’s invoice date. KOS may bill in advance or in arrears for Services. Service Agreements may also modify the billing terms for certain Services.

**8. How can I pay my bill?**

You can pay your bill through auto payment or online through a bank account from a list of select financial institutions (provided to you upon request) that KOS may change from time to time, by cheque (through the mail), by debit, by cash or with select credit cards. You confirm that you are an authorized user of the credit card or bank account and that it is valid and has not expired. You must promptly advise KOS if your credit card or bank account information changes.

**9. What charges apply to late payments, rejected payments and other account processing actions?**

If KOS does not receive payment within fifteen (**15**) days of the invoice date, you will be subject to a late payment charge of **2%** per month. This late payment charge accrues on a daily basis and is calculated and compounded monthly on the outstanding amount (**26.82%** per year) (**“Late Payment Charges”**) from the date of the first bill on which it appears until the date we receive that amount in full.

You agree that we can charge any unpaid and outstanding amount, including any Late Payment Charges and taxes, on your account to your credit card, bank account or any other payment method pre-authorized by you for payment of Fees.

Administrative charges in amounts up to $50.00 may be levied for administration or account processing activities in connection with your account, including as a result of the following:

**10. What if I dispute Fees on my invoice?**

If you have any questions, disputes or discrepancies to report regarding Fees, you must do so within ninety (**90**) days of the invoice date. Failure to notify us within this time period will constitute your acceptance of such Fees. We will investigate disputes and if, at our sole discretion, we determine that a portion of the Fees was incorrectly charged, then we will reverse the disputed portion of the Fees. You must pay the undisputed portion of the Fees in accordance with Section 8.

##### YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

**11. Does KOS have any policies that apply to the Services?**

Yes. From time to time, KOS may establish policies, rules and limits (collectively **“Policies”**) concerning the use of the Services, Equipment and any products, content, applications or services used in conjunction with the Services or Equipment. The Policies are incorporated into these Service Terms by reference. Policies are published by unambiguous links on the Website. The terms of Section 5 apply to the introduction of new Policies or changes to existing Policies.

1. Transfer your Services without our express consent. You must also follow any Policies setting out acceptable use guidelines for the Services and Equipment.

**13. How can I be sure that KOS has accurate contact information for my account?**

You are responsible for keeping the contact and payment information you provide to KOS (including name, mailing address, email address, address where the Services will be provided to you), phone number, and any authorized users up to date. If this Agreement is cancelled, you will provide KOS with forwarding information for final invoices or correspondence if your new contact information is different from the information we have on file. Failure to provide a forwarding address may result in the forfeiture of any outstanding credits or deposits on your account.

**14. What am I responsible for if my KOS account is compromised?**

You must notify KOS immediately should you suspect unauthorized use of the Services or if Equipment is lost or stolen. You are responsible for payment of all Fees and taxes charged to your account, whether authorized by you or not, which is why it is so important to protect your account and keep account information (including authorized users) up-to-date.

**18. How do I transfer my phone number from KOS to another service provider?**

Upon your request or at the request of your new service provider, if your assigned account and phone numbers are active, KOS will process a “transfer-out” request for a phone number assigned to you to your new chosen service provider. Upon transfer-out, the Service Agreements pertaining to the transferred Services and phone number(s) will be cancelled automatically, pursuant to Section 34. You are responsible for all Fees and taxes associated with the transfer from KOS, including any applicable Cancellation Charges, as defined in Section 36.

**21. Will the Service ever require changes of Equipment?**

Yes. The Equipment, Equipment specifications and the location of Equipment require changes, at our sole discretion, from time to time. Unless otherwise specified by us, you are solely responsible for updating or maintaining your Equipment and software as necessary to meet such requirements, and you may not be entitled to customer support from us if you fail to do so.

Yes. By entering into the Agreement, you are providing your consent to receive commercial electronic messages from KOS. However, at any time, you may unsubscribe from commercial electronic messages by using the unsubscribe mechanism contained in such messages.

##### SERVICES, VoIP AND RELATED LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

**29. Is 9-1-1 service always available over VoIP?**

No. There are some important differences and limitations in how 9-1-1 calling over VoIP technology operates when compared to basic and E9-1-1 services provided over traditional landline telephone service. Please review this section carefully before activating, installing or using KOS VoIP services.

With both traditional basic 9-1-1 and E9-1-1 services, your call is sent directly to the nearest emergency response centre. In addition, with E9-1-1 service, your call back number and last address are visible to the emergency response centre call-taker. With KOS VoIP service 9-1-1 calling, your call is sent to a national emergency call centre. When you make a 9-1-1 call using KOS VoIP services, you will be asked to confirm your location information regardless of whether that information is visible to the call centre operator. The call centre operator will then transfer your 9-1-1 call to the emergency response centre nearest your location. You should be prepared to provide or confirm your name, address and call-back number with the operator. Do not hang up unless you are told to do so. If your call is disconnected, immediately dial 9-1-1 again.

If you are unable to speak during a 9-1-1 call and the call centre operator has access to a call-back number and the last registered address associated with your KOS VoIP service, the operator will transfer the call to the emergency response centre closest to that address. In order for emergency services to be dispatched to the correct address in such cases, you must ensure that the registered address that you have provided to is always the same as the physical address at which your VoIP device is located. Whenever you move the physical location of your VoIP device or you add a line or port a number, you must update your registered address accordingly. You may update your location information by logging-in to your customer portal and changing your recorded location information. Your customer portal can be accessed using the following url: <Link href="https://voip.kos.net/">https://voip.kos.net/</Link>

You acknowledge and understand that the KOS VoIP service or access to the KOS VoIP service, including 9-1-1, public alerts or special needs services, may not function correctly, or at all, in the following circumstances:

- If your Equipment fails, is not configured correctly or does not meet KOS’ requirements;

- In the event of a high-speed Internet service outage, regardless of the supplier providing the high-speed Internet service to you;

- In the event of a network outage or power failure;

- If you or somebody else tampers with or, in some cases, move the Equipment; or

- Following suspension or termination of your KOS Services or Account.

There may be a greater possibility of network congestion and/or reduced speed in the routing of a 9-1-1 calls made utilizing KOS VoIP service as compared to traditional 9-1-1 calls dialled over traditional public telephone networks.

KOS does not currently offer Operator Service and so emergency services cannot be accessed through an operator by dialing “0”.

You should inform any business or household residents, guests and other persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize KOS VoIP service, of the important differences and limitations of VoIP 9-1-1 calling as compared with traditional E-9-1-1 service, as set out above.

KOS does not have any control over whether, or the manner in which, calls using KOS VoIP Service 9-1-1 calling service are answered or addressed by any local emergency response centre. KOS disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centres and the national emergency calling centre. KOS relies on third parties to assist it in routing 9-1-1 calls to local emergency response centres and to a national emergency calling centre. KOS disclaims any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route calls is incorrect or yields an erroneous result.

**30. How do KOS Parties limit their liability for VoIP 9-1-1 services?**

KOS Parties limits their liability for VoIP 9-1-1 services as follows:

You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, KOS Parties will not be liable for any injury, death or damage to persons or property, arising directly or indirectly out of, or relating in any way to 9-1-1 calling from your KOS VoIP Service and you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the KOS Parties for any liabilities, claims, damages, losses and expenses, (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) which you or anyone accessing or attempting to access 9-1-1 calling from your KOS VoIP Service may suffer or incur, arising directly or indirectly out of or relating to your or that person’s failure to obtain access to 9-1-1 emergency services.

##### LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

**31. How does KOS limit its liability?**

You agree that, unless otherwise specifically set out in a Service Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, KOS Parties’ liability for negligence, breach of contract, tort, or other causes of action, including fundamental breach, is limited to a maximum amount equal to the greater of twenty (**$20**) or an amount equal to the Fees payable during any service outage.

Other than the foregoing payment and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, KOS Parties are not responsible to anyone for:

- Any direct, indirect, special, consequential, incidental, economic or punitive damages (including loss of profit or revenue, financial loss, loss of business opportunities, loss, destruction or alteration of data, files or software, breach of privacy or security property damage, personal injury, death or any other foreseeable or unforeseeable loss, however caused) resulting or relating directly or indirectly to the Service or any advertisements, promotions or statements relating to any of the foregoing, even if we were negligent or were advised of the possibility of such damages;

  - The performance, availability, reliability, timeliness, quality, coverage, uninterrupted use, security, pricing or operation of the Service;

  - Any error, inclusion or omission with respect to any telephone listings or directories;

  - The denial, restriction, blocking, disruption or inaccessibility of any Services, including 9-1-1, public alerts or special needs services, Equipment or Identifiers;

  - Any lost, stolen, damaged or expired Equipment, Identifiers, passwords, codes, benefits, discounts, rebates or credits;

  - Any error, omission or delay in connection with the transfer of Identifiers to or from another telecommunications service provider or any limitation connected thereto;

  - Any acts or omissions of a telecommunications carrier whose facilities are used to establish connections to points that we do not serve; or

  - Any claims or damages resulting directly or indirectly from any claim that the use, intended use or combination of the service or any material transmitted through the Services infringes the intellectual property, industrial, contractual, privacy or other rights of a third party.

These limits are in addition to any other limits on KOS Parties’ liability set out elsewhere in the Agreement.

**32. Must I indemnify KOS Parties with regards to the Agreement?**

Yes. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless KOS Parties from all demands, claims, proceedings, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by or made against KOS Parties, which result from or relate to the Services, your use of the Services or other matters related to this Agreement.

##### CANCELLING AND SUSPENDING KOS SERVICES

**33. When and how can I cancel Services?**

You may cancel any or all of your Services and any corresponding Service Agreement at any time by contacting KOS at the points of contact specified in these Service Terms. Cancellation Charges, as defined in Section 36, may apply.

**34. What happens to a Service Agreement if I transfer my Services to another provider?**

Upon transfer-out of one or more Services and Identifiers to another provider, the applicable Service Agreements will be automatically cancelled. Cancellation Charges, as defined in Section 36, may apply.

**35. When can KOS cancel or suspend my Services?**

KOS may cancel any or all of your Services and corresponding Service Agreements upon no less than thirty (30) days’ notice to you by email or by mail to your billing address.

KOS may also restrict, block, suspend, disconnect or terminate any or all of your Services, including 9-1-1 service, for cause, without notice, if:

- you are in breach of a Service Agreement, including non-payment of your charges or non-compliance with any Policies;

- you do not maintain Service usage within the prescribed credit limit;

- you exceed reasonable usage limits, as determined by us;

- you have given us false, misleading or outdated information

- we reasonably suspect or determine that any of your Services, Equipment and / or Identifiers are the subject of fraudulent, unlawful or improper usage or usage that adversely affects our operations or the use of our services, facilities or networks by others;

- you harass, threaten or abuse us or our employees or agents;

- you fraudulently or improperly seek to avoid payment to us;

- we need to install, maintain, inspect, test, repair, remove, replace, investigate, protect, modify, upgrade or improve the operation of the Services, the Equipment or our facilities or networks; or

- we reasonably believe that there is an emergency or extreme circumstance that would warrant such action.

**36. What are my obligations if my Service(s) are cancelled or transferred to another provider?**

If you or KOS cancels one or more of your Services that are subject to a month-to-month Term or if your Services are transferred to another provider, you must pay all outstanding fees (including any installation fees for Services that have been installed but not activated), taxes, and Late Payment Charges on your final invoice for those cancelled Services. One-time activation and installation fees are non-refundable. A re-stocking fee may apply to Equipment that you return or Equipment that has been ordered but not shipped. If Equipment that you have purchased has been shipped prior to Service cancellation, the fees for the Equipment are non-refundable. One-time activation and installation fees and restocking/Equipment fees are intended to recover costs and constitute a genuine pre-estimate of liquidated damages in the event that a month-to-month Service is cancelled. Any Equipment that you lease from KOS, except for certain Equipment, such as fixed wireless equipment, that may require a KOS technician for retrieval, must be returned by mail at the address listed in Section 45 within thirty (30) days of the date that Services are cancelled by you or KOS.

For month-to-month Services, KOS will provide a refund for the cancelled portion of monthly service Fees that you have paid in advance for Services. This refund will be pro-rated based on the number of days left in the last monthly billing cycle after cancellation.

If you cancel a Service that is subject to a Fixed Term prior to its expiry, or if KOS cancels for cause your Service that is subject to a Fixed Term, then you must pay KOS an amount equal to fifty per cent (**50%**) of the remaining monthly Fees for the cancelled Service that would have been payable to the end of the Fixed Term, plus applicable taxes (collectively, the **“Cancellation Charges”**). You acknowledge that the Cancellation Charges are a reasonable estimate of KOS’s liquidated damages, represent consideration for the Services, and are not a penalty.

**37. How can I restore my Service(s) if they have been restricted, blocked, suspended, disconnected or terminated by KOS?**

KOS may, at its sole discretion, restore your Services, with or without conditions that may include:

1. Full repayment of outstanding amounts owing to KOS;

1. Compensation for costs incurred by KOS in connection with your breach of the Service Terms, including costs incurred to enforce your compliance; or

1. Changes to your Fees on an ongoing basis
