The following are some frequently asked questions to help you better understand the available VoIP 911 on the (Client) home phone service and your responsibilities in having it.

#### 1) DO I GET ACCESS TO 911 SERVICES?

Yes as a (Client) home phone user, you get access to VoIP 911 services, only if you have given consent to (Client) to forward your private user data to the emergency dispatch center, provided that data is accurate and correct, which will be certified by our (Client) home phone support staff, once certified you will be able to successfully dial 911 and receive the emergency response services.

#### 2) WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOIP 911 AND TRADITIONAL 911?

The VoIP 911 service that (Client) home phone provides has certain limitations relative to traditional 911 services that are available on most traditional telephone services, in that your client information is being sent over the internet rather then over a traditional phone line, meaning a different method is required to send this client information accurately.

#### 3) WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO THE OPERATOR OR WHOEVER PICKS UP?

Be prepared to confirm your location and telephone number with the operator who answers the 911 call since the operator may not have this information. It is also recommended to keep in mind who your VoIP provider is because if necessary, the central call centers can contact them in severe emergency situations. It is also encouraged to not hang up until told to do so, and to call back if you get disconnected, as immediately as possible.

#### 4) IS THERE EVER A POSSIBILITY MY 911 SERVICE WONâ€™T WORK?

VoIP 911 service may not be available during a power outage and will be unavailable during a broadband internet outage.

#### 5) WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KEEP MY 911 INFORMATION UP-TO-DATE?

Keeping updated information is a way of ensuring that your location information is kept current with your VoIP service provider. Since the operator may assume that you are at the last registered address if you are not able to speak during a 911 call, this information is used to accurately connect you to the appropriate emergency response center, and subsequently the appropriate emergency response.

#### 6) HOW DO I KEEP THIS INFORMATION UP-TO-DATE?

As a (Client) home phone user the information is easily changed by calling into the (Client) home phone call center, and or changing and resubmitting the information online.

#### 7) HOW DO I KEEP THIS INFORMATION UP-TO-DATE?

E911 stands for Enhance 911. It is an enhanced version of the 911 emergency services, and is provided by the (Client) home phone service. When you use this service, your personal information like name and address are automatically given to your local dispatch center or Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) over the internet.
