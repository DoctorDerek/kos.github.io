##### 3. OBTAINING CONSENT FOR COLLECTION, USE OR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

3.1. KOS requires Customers’ and Employees’ knowledge and consent for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, except in the circumstances described in Sections 3.3 through 3.6 below, where knowledge or consent would be inappropriate.

3.2 In general, implied consent for KOS to collect, use and disclose Personal Information for all identified purposes is obtained in the following circumstances: (1) when a Customer applies for KOS services or products; (2) when a Customer uses KOS services or products; (3) when an individual submits an application for employment with KOS; or (4) when an Employee accepts employment or benefits from KOS. Notwithstanding, KOS shall seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information at the same time it collects the information. However, KOS may seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.

3.3 KOS may collect, use or disclose Personal Information without a Customer’s or Employee’s knowledge or consent only in the following, exceptional circumstances:

1. For the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or contravention of a law that has been, is being or is about to be committed;

1. Detecting or suppressing fraud or of preventing fraud that is likely to be committed.

and it would be reasonable to expect that disclosure with the knowledge or consent of an individual would compromise the investigation or the ability to prevent, detect or suppress the fraud.

1. KOS and the other entity(ies) involved in the prospective Business Transaction have entered into an agreement that requires the organization that receives Personal Information:

   1. To use and disclose that information solely for purposes related to the Business Transaction;

   1. To protect that information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information; and

The Personal Information is necessary

1.  To determine whether to proceed with the Business Transaction; and

1.  If the determination is made to proceed with the transaction, to complete it.

3.6 If a prospective Business Transaction that is referred to in Section 3.5 is completed, the organizations that are party to that Business Transaction may use and disclose Personal Information, which was disclosed in accordance with Section 3.5, without the knowledge or consent of the Customer or Employee if:

1. The organizations have entered into an agreement that requires them to:

   1. Use and disclose the Personal Information under their respective control solely for the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected, permitted to be used or disclosed before the Business Transaction was completed;

   1. To protect the Personal Information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information; and

   1. To give effect to any withdrawal of consent by a Customer or Employee; and

1. The Personal Information is necessary for carrying on the business or activity that was the object of the Business Transaction; and

1. One of the parties notifies the Customer or Employee, within a reasonable time after the transaction is completed, that the Business Transaction has been completed and its Personal Information has been disclosed.

3.7 In obtaining consent, KOS shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Customer or Employee is advised of the identified purposes for which Personal Information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the Customer and Employee.

3.8 KOS will require consent for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information as a condition of the supply of a service or product only if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.

3.9 In determining the appropriate form of consent, KOS shall take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable expectations of its Customers and Employees.

9.3 In certain situations, KOS may not be able to provide access to all the Personal Information that it holds about a Customer or Employee. For example, KOS may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal Personal Information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.

The notification will allow the individual to understand the significance of the breach and to take steps, if any are possible, to reduce the risk of harm that could result from it or to mitigate that harm.

10.3 In assessing whether there exists a real risk of significant harm, KOS will consider factors including:

1. the sensitivity of the Personal Information involved in the breach;
